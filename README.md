## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
No instalations needed to run the code. 
The code will run using Python 3 and earlier versions. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Main motivation for this project is to provide an overlook for both properties owner and customers who are using Airbnb in Seatlle.  

I have tried to answer a few questions that will give an idea about he distribution of prices and availabilities across different neighbourhoods and timeframes. 

1- What is the average price / availability distribution over the year? 

2- What is the most rented type of unites? 

3- On average, where are the locations of the most rented units?

4- what are the features of the most rented units? 

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The is one notebook here containing the following: 
1- Importing neccessory libraries and datasets 
2- Exploratory Data Analysis
3- Data Transformations
4- Data Visualization 

The notebook clearly follow the CRISP (Cross Industry Standard Processes) Methodology and has a clear documentations that explain the logics behinde the code. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://).
