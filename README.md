## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
No instalations needed to run the code. 
The code will run using Python 3 and earlier versions. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Main motivation for this project is to provide an overlook for both properties owner and customers who are using Airbnb in Seatlle.  

I have tried to answer a few questions that will give an idea about he distribution of prices and availabilities across different neighbourhoods and timeframes. 

1- What is the average price / availability distribution over the year? 

2- What is the most rented type of unites? 

3- On average, where are the locations of the most rented units?

4- what are the features of the most rented units? 

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The is one notebook here containing the following: 
1- What is the percentage of available properties on Airbnb during different times of the year?
2- What is the average price of properties listed on Airbnb during different seasons? Is there a spike in prices over certain times?
3- Do certain neighborhoods rent out more properties than others?
4- Does the price average varies between different neighborhoods?
5- Where are the most rented properties located in Seattle?
6- What are the most distinguished features of the most rented properties?

The notebook clearly follow the CRISP (Cross Industry Standard Processes) Methodology and has a clear documentations that explain the logics behinde the code. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>
